# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow (Low-Level API)

## Project Description

This project implements a neural network from scratch using TensorFlow's low-level API (without Keras `Sequential`). The model is designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. The network consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.

## 📊 **Model Architecture**

* Input layer: 32x32x3 (flattened to 3072)
* Hidden layer 1: 512 neurons, ReLU activation
* Hidden layer 2: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
* Hidden layer 3: 128 neurons, ReLU activation
* Hidden layer 4: 64 neurons, ReLU activation
* Softmax activation (for multi-class classification)
